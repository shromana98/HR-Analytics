🌟📊 Just wrapped up an exhilarating HR Analytics project utilizing MySQL and Power BI!

# 🎯 Project Objective: 

The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data analysis on the HR dataset. 
The analysis aims to extract valuable insights and patterns related to employee information, such as turnover rates, departmental trends, and more.

# Data Used : HR Dataset (Kaggle)

# 🧹 Data Cleaning:

- Removing duplicates.
- Ensuring data consistency.
- Validating date formats.

# 🔍 Data Analysis:

1. Employee Demographics: Understanding the age distribution and other demographic characteristics of employees.
2. Turnover Analysis: Analyzing turnover rates and identifying factors contributing to employee departures.
3. Departmental Insights: Examining department-specific trends and performance.
4. Tenure Analysis: Evaluating employee tenure and its impact on the organization.
5. Time Series Analysis: Exploring patterns over time, including hiring and termination trends.

🛠 Leveraging the power of MySQL, I ensured seamless data management and manipulation, allowing for efficient querying and extraction of pertinent information. And with Power BI's intuitive visualization capabilities, I transformed raw data into compelling dashboards and reports, offering stakeholders a comprehensive view of the organization's HR landscape. 📈

# 💡 Insights: 

- There are more male employees
- White race is the most dominant while Native Hawaiian and American Indian are the least dominant.
- The youngest employee is 21 years old and the oldest is 58 years old
- A large number of employees were between 25-34 followed by 35-44 while the smallest group was 55-64.
